# Virgil Security JavaScript Crypto Library - Create React App
First, you need an ability to tweak create-react-app configs. You have 2 options here:
- Override options using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) or its alternatives.
- [Eject](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject). Please note that this is a one-way operation.

After that you need to follow our [Webpack guide](webpack.md).
